# 🛣️ Road Pavement Condition Indexing Using Machine Learning

This project was developed as my Final Year Project at UET, aimed at predicting road pavement conditions using machine learning models based on survey and environmental data.

---

## 📌 Objective

To automate the classification of road pavement conditions (e.g., Good, Fair, Poor) using supervised machine learning models — helping authorities prioritize maintenance more efficiently.

---

## 🧠 ML Models Used

- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree (for comparison)  
- Logistic Regression (baseline)

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Data collected from road survey reports (sample structured data)  
- Features include:  
  - Pavement distress scores  
  - Cracks, potholes, raveling, rutting indicators  
  - Environmental and usage factors (e.g., traffic level)

> **Note:** Raw data is anonymized for privacy. You can replace it with your own or synthetic sample.
